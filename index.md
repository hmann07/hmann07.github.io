## Projects
- MSc Project using the actor model to construct and evolve artifical neural neworks. Based on the NEAT and HyperNeat methodologies.
  <https://github.com/hmann07/project>
  
- Rewrite of MSc project to dockerise, write using FSM api, a front end using Play / react.js / d3.js / websockets and a mongoDB-reactivemongo database for managing neural network representations and evolution results <https://github.com/hmann07/thingy>
  
- Mobile Computing coursework to create an andorid application that utilised a 3rd indoor location detection library to display indoor location and react to predefined geofences.
  <https://github.com/hmann07/AndroidMUC-Coursework>

- Code related to a mix of languages. Artifical Neural Network using backpropagation written in Node.js. Python code related to coursework to write map-reduce jobs in EMR.     standard code exercises (fib etc..) in prolog. <https://github.com/hmann07/progLang>


- In spare time playing around with Geographical data in 3d tools and game engines. Some renders and screenshots below.
